Here are some personal reflections on the project and process by current or former team members:

Working on TicText with the team was an excellent experience. It was fun working with a team with a variety of skills and where each member had something to contribute. In every weekly meeting, someone would bring something new that we couldn't wait to share at the next iteration presentation. On a personal level, I have enjoyed improving my teamwork and formalized software development skills. I will miss expressing myself through emoticons and the often moments of, ``Huh!'' when learning something new in code reviews. But ultimately, seeing this project grow from a single log-in view controller to the final product has given me the greatest satisfaction.

I learned a lot by working on this project, in terms of both iOS development skill and software engineering technique. Before this semester, I have never done any iOS development. Now, by learning from my experienced team members and online sources, I am more proficient in this field. I wrote code following consistent code convention with documentation and tests. We followed XP, always creating pull request before merging into master and reviewing/commenting othersâ€™ code. And we have user stories done after every iteration.

I learned how to incorporate my project into parse and use different testing frameworks. I worked on the FindFriendsViewController and the original conversation view. I also worked on creating the header above the settings view controller. I liked using parse, I thought it was a great framework, I enjoyed the code reviews, it made me a much better coder and more careful of what I was writing. Having branches that weren't merged into master after iterations ended up causing a lot of headaches down the road.

While working on this project I learnt a lot about iOS development and about Parse framework. I found it useful to meet each week to discuss our work and plan for the iteration meeting with the TA (who is simulating a client). That definitely helped everyone to be on track with the current state work. Also using Github and its Pull Request system made code review possible. Everyone who has access to the repository can review the history of commits, which makes our work very transparent to an outsider.
