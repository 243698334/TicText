While working on this project I learnt a lot about iOS development and about Parse framework. I found it useful to meet each week to discuss our work and plan for the iteration meeting with the TA (who is simulating a client). That definitely helped everyone to be on track with the current state work. Also using Github and its Pull Request system made code review possible. Everyone who has access to the repository can review the history of commits, which makes our work very transparent to an outsider.
