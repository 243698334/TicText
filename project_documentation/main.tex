% Goals of the Documentation
\clearpage
\section{Goals of the Documentation}
You should write your documentation as though you are explaining your project to a new developer who is about to join your team. You should include enough details so that he or she can get started quickly. On the other hand, the documentation should not overwhelm them with too much information that can be easily discovered by reading the code.
Your documentation should include pointers to important facts that you wished you had known when you started the project, e.g., limitations of a framework you used or a workaround for a nasty bug you encountered, etc. These are things that people cannot figure out quickly unless it has been documented.

%% Final Documentation
\subsection{Final Documentation}
The documentation is worth 20 points. It needs to include the following items (you can use this as a guide for the table of contents):

You should be able to re-use material from the homeworks and your writing assignments (if you are taking CS429) while preparing the documentation.

%% Formatting Guidelines
\subsection{Formatting Guidelines}
\begin{enumerate}
\item All class, method names, code must be in \texttt{monospace font}. Use a font like Courier, Monaco, etc
\item All figures must be labeled.
\item Do not draw the diagrams by hand â€“ use a diagraming tool.
\item Your documentation should be at least 5 pages but not more than 15 pages.
\end{enumerate}
